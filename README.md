## Python Keylogger

Clone this repository, then run the following command to install the correct libraries.
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Needs to be ran with sudo since it will need access to keyboard strokes. 

Can be ran with 
`sudo python3 keylogger.py` or `sudo ./keylogger.py` since the shebang line is present.
